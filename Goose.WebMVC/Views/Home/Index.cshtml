        <p>
            I was tired of my bill collecting job so I took a software development course and this is the result of it thus far. I am hopeful to team up with one or two other people to populate it and get the front and back end working in a way past a minimal viable product. Hopefully in the future I can add show ratings and song histories. Either way, welcome, poke around and enjoy. My contact information can be found below if you're intersted in working on this with me. Perhaps if we're really lucky we can use this raise some money for harm reduction at shows.
        </p>
